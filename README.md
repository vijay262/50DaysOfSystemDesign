# 50 Days of System Design 

Welcome to my personal learning journey ‚Äî 50 days of System Design.  
This repo will cover everything I learn daily ‚Äî from basics to real-world system designs, interview-level architecture, and performance tips.

---

## Why I'm doing this?

I realized System Design is not just for interviews ‚Äî it‚Äôs the base of how big systems actually work.

So instead of just reading scattered articles, I decided to follow a 50-day structure where I:

- Learn one topic daily
- Write short, clear notes
- Add diagrams whenever needed
- Note down key trade-offs and interview points

This repo is my second brain for System Design.
